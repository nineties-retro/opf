.asm.format: Due to a combination of only having GAS on my machine and
 also being used to AT&T format assembler, OPF is written in AT&T format
 rather than Intel format.

.vm: The OPF virtual machine uses the following virtual registers :-

.vm.P: the instruction pointer
.vm.R: the address of the last item added to the return stack.
.vm.S: the address of the next to last item added to the data stack.
.vm.T: the last item added to the data stack.
.vm.H: the address of next available byte in the header space.
.vm.C: the address of next available byte in the code space.
.vm.D: the address of the last word entered into the dictionary.
.vm.B: the current base used for all numeric input/output.

.vm.mapping: How these virtual registers are mapped to x86 registers
 influences the speed and size of the VM and the resulting code.

.vm.mapping.P: In a subroutine threaded implementation there is no choice
 but to use eip for P.

.vm.mapping.R: esp is the obvious choice for R since the call/ret
 instructions implicitly push and pop values from it.  Using any other
 register in a subroutine threaded forth would be perverse.

.vm.mapping.S: The obvious choice would be esp since there
 are special instructions for accessing esp as a stack.  However, esp
 is being used as the return stack (see .vm.mapping.R).  Consequently,
 ebp is used to hold S.  The choice of ebp was mainly govered by the
 fact that it is often used as a frame pointer rather than a general
 register in x86 code and so using for a second stack seems a
 reasonable choice. 

.vm.S.direction: Since the hardware stack (esp) grows downwards,
 a downward growing stack is the most familiar direction on an x86.
 Consequently S grows downwards.  Other than familiarity there is no reason
 why the stack should not grow upwards, and there is a small technical
 advantage to doing so when it comes to certain system calls (see
 opf_trap_n_code). 

.vm.S.top: There are two conventions about what S can point to.  It
 can either point to the last item added to the stack or it can point
 to the next free location on the stack.  In the absence of special
 instructions which favour either one, then the choice of which to use
 is arbitrary.  However, there is something to be said for using the
 former in a stack which grows down (initialise S to one past the end
 of the stack area) and the latter for stacks which grow up.  Since
 the the choice of stack direction has been made (see .vm.S.direction)
 then the former is used.

.vm.S.access: Since there are no special instructions for accessing ebp,
 a mov+sub are required to push a value onto the stack and a mov+add
 to remove it.  Given the stack direction (see .vm.S.direction) and
 what it points at (see .vm.S.top) then an obvious way to code a push
 a value on the stack is :-

  subl $4, %ebp
  movl <whatever>, (%ebp)

 However, this suffers from an address generation interlock (AGI) since
 the move instruction has to wait for the sub instruction to generate the
 correct value for ebp and so it causes an extra delay (see
 opf/bib#pentium page F-7 for some more information on AGIs).  Consequently,
 the code is reordered and use is made of a negative offset to push
 the value on the stack.
 
  movl <whatever>, -4(%ebp)
  subl $4, %ebp

 Note that accessing a hardware stack below its current value is a 
 recipe for disaster since any value to place there could be overwritten
 by an interrupt that occurs between the mov and sub but since the hardware
 does not push anything on ebp, it is safe to use it in this manner.

.vm.mapping.T: In many cases the code sequence to perform an
 operation on eax is shorter than for any other register and so eax
 makes an attractive choice for T.

.vm.mapping.{H,C,D,B}: Given the lack of registers on the x86 none of
 these virtual registers is kept in an x86 register.  Instead they are
 each kept in a variable: opf_H, opf_C, opf_D and opf_B respectively.


XXX the rest of this document refers to the code in opf.s

opf_C_default_size
 what:
  The maximum size, in bytes, of the area for holding all code that is
  generated when OPF words are compiled.  The size can be overridden
  on the command line using -c, see _start for more information.

opf_H_default_size
 what:
  The maximum size, in bytes, of the area for holding the headers of any
  OPF words that are compiled.  The size can be overriden on the command
  line using the -h option, see _start for more information.

opf_S_default_size
 what:
  The maximum size, in bytes, of the area containing the parameter stack.
  The size can be overriden on the command line using the -s option,
  see _start for more information.


opf_Q_size
 what:
  The maximum number of elements that can appear in the code optimisation
  queue.  To simplify the code it must be a power of 2.  Note that if
  you change this, you'll also need to alter the definition of opf_Q.


opf_in_fd_block_size
 what:
  The size, in bytes, of the input buffer associated with each opf_in.
  The same size is used for all input buffers.  There is currently no
  way to override the size on the command line -- XXX add this feature.


opf_cell_size
 what:
  The size of a cell in bytes.  This is defined by the architecture and
  in the case of an x86 it is 4.


opf_char_size
 what:
  The size of a character in bytes.  OPF only supports ASCII, so the size
  is 1.

opf_bits_per_char
 what:
  The number of bits in one character.  OPF only supports ASCII, so don't
  alter this unless you are involved in a rewrite.

opf_pad_size
 what:
  The size, in bytes, of the area used to temporarily hold characters that
  are output by opf_dot_code.  It should be large enough to hold the
  maximum integer in base 2.  There is currently no way to override the
  size on the command line, and it is unlikely that it will be added since
  the upper bound is not very big and so it makes sense just to use the
  maximum size.


opf_syscall
 what:
  The interrupt code for a system call under Linux.  This is fixed by
  the Linux kernel, so do not alter it.  The same is true for all the
  following opf_syscall_XXX values, their values are taken from 
  /usr/include/sys/syscall.h :-

opf_syscall_exit
opf_syscall_read
opf_syscall_write
opf_syscall_open
opf_syscall_close
opf_syscall_mmap

opf_exit_success
 what:
  When passed as an argument to the exit system call, the process terminates
  and returns a successful status.

opf_exit_failure
 what:
  When passed as an argument to the exit system call, the process terminates
  and returns a failure status.

opf_mmap_prot_none
opf_mmap_prot_read
opf_mmap_prot_write
opf_mmap_prot_exec
 what:
  The various protections that can be applied to a mmapped page.
  Their numeric values are taken from /usr/include/asm/mman.h
  See mmap(2) for more information.

opf_mmap_map_shared
opf_mmap_map_private
opf_mmap_map_fixed
opf_mmap_map_anonymous
  The various flags that can be applied when mapping a page.
  Their numeric values are taken from /usr/include/asm/mman.h
  See mmap(2) for more information.


opf_stdin
opf_stdout
opf_stderr
 what:
  The three standard file descriptors that are opened for a process: 
  input, output and error output.


opf_h
 what:
  A word header contains five pieces of information: the name of the
  word, the length of the name (opf_h_len), a link to the next word in
  the dictionary (opf_h_next) aka the link field address or LFA, a
  pointer to the code associated with the word (opf_h_code) aka the
  code field address or CFA and a pointer to the compiler for the word
  (opf_h_comp).  

  Note that the name does not actually have an offset, that is because
  the name is actually stored before the header, a header pointer
  actually contains the address of length field.  The start of the name
  can be determined by subtracting the length from this.  For example, 
  the following bit of ASCII art shows two words in the dictionary, "foo"
  and "to".
                           _
                          ---
                           |
     0               4     |         8              12              
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | f | o | o | 3 |       0       | foo code addr | foo compiler  |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                 ^
                 |
                 +-----+
    16              20 |            24              28  
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   | t | o | 2 |       4       | to code addr  |  to compiler  |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
               ^
               |
              top

  Since headers a kept separate and have a relatively small size, the
  link to the next word could be represented by a byte-offset rather
  than a full word.  However, this can make dealing with overflow of the
  header area more complicated.  With a word for the link, all that is
  necessary is to allocate a new block and make the first word in it
  point back to the previous block.  With a byte offset I can only think
  of two solutions: adding a bit somewhere in the header to indicate whether
  it is a default or extended header or mmapping a large block,
  copying the initial headers into it and allocating a page every time
  overflow occurs.  There is not much to be said for the former
  approach since it complicates the common case at the expense of the
  uncommon.  The second approach has a lot going for it, especially
  since it would be easy to map say 1MB of linear address space and be
  confident that even the largest applications would not need it all.
  This is something to look at once the word based version works.

  Allowing a separate compiler for each word makes it easy to install
  custom compilers that inline or otherwise much about with the object
  code that is planted for a word.  It is not strictly necessary but it
  does make adding extensions easier.

opf_q_head_drop_lit
opf_q_head_lit
opf_q_head_max
 what:
  The boundary between special head values (below this value) and the
  addresses of real headers (above this value).  This is set to the
  address of the start of the text region since headers since the way
  the Linux x86 memory management works ensures that all mmapped regions
  are above this address.

opf_error_eoi XXX document this
opf_error_bad_word XXX document this


opf_argc
opf_argv
 what:
  argc and argv are equivalent to the two arguments to main in C.


opf_B
 what:
  The current base for all numeric input and output.  It should lie
  in the range [2,36].  Outside that and the results are
  <code>undefined</code>.

opf_C:
 what:
  Holds the address of the start of the code area.

opf_C_size
 what:
  Holds the size, in bytes, of the code area.  This is only currently
  used during command line parsing.

opf_H:
 what:
  Holds the address of the start of the header area.

opf_H_size
 what:
  Holds the size, in bytes, of the header area.  This is only currently
  used during command line parsing.


opf_S:
 what:
  Holds the address of the start of the parameter stack area.

opf_S_size
 what:
  Holds the size, in bytes, of the parameter stack area.  This is only
  currently used during command line parsing.


opf_D
 what:
  Holds the address of the last word defined in the dictionary.  Note that
  unlike most Forth implementations, if a word is currently being defined
  then its header will be in opf_D.

opf_I
 what:
  Holds the address of the current input stream.


opf_X
 what:
  Contains the address of the compiler to associate with any definition.
  This has been included because at the outset of implementing
  something like the Color Forth idea of defining up front what sort
  of words are coming.  At present it is underused since there is only
  one sort of definition.  When variables are added it make some sense,
  as will it if constants are made a special case.


opf_L
 what:
  Contains the address of a 0 terminated vector of addresses of strings
  that represent libraries to search when opening a OPF file.  Note
  that the vector is stored in monotonically *decreasing* addresses
  rather than the usual *increasing* addresses.
 how:
  The reason for *decreasing* addresses is that the vector is stored on
  the return stack.  The reason for using the return stack is that at
  the time that the command line options are parsed, the return stack
  is the only area that has been allocated.


opf_Q
 what:
  The base of the code optimisation queue.  Each element in the queue
  consists of a pair of words: the address of the word header and the
  start address of where in the current word the code was planted.
 how:
  Instead of using .space to initialise the queue, explicit .longs have
  been used.  This is because the last slot needs to be initialised with
  the address of some code (any code not starting with a call will do)
  so that opf_return_code does not blow up when a check is made to see
  if the code at that address starts with a call.  This could be done
  independently of the size, by using a couple of loads and a store at
  initialisation time, but I'm loathe to waste this space when it is
  unlikely that the queue will be anything other than 4 long (even 4
  is on the large side!).


opf_Qi
 what:
  Holds the index of last slot to be used in the code optimisation queue.
  The reason for holding the last slot rather than the next free slot
  is that it simplifies accessing the last used slot i.e. no
  calculation is required.  Note that the index is stored pre-scaled.


opf_defined_vector
 inputs:
  %ecx = length of the name of the word just found.
  %edx = dictionary header of found word.
  %edi = address of first character in word name (note this is the one
         that has just been read in, not the one in the just located header).
  %esi = address of one past the last character in the name in the
         dictionary header.
 outputs:
  whatever the word wants to do.
 what:
  Execution is vectored through here every time a word is encountered
  by the text interpreter.  It usually contains either opf_defined_interpret
  or opf_defined_compile but users are free to alter it if they wish to
  alter the way the text interpreter works.


opf_undefined_vector
 inputs:
  %ecx = length of the name of the word that was not found in dictionary.
  %edx = 0
  %esi = address of first character in word name (note this is the one
         that has just been read in, not the one in the just located header).
 outputs:
  whatever the word wants to do.
 what:
  Execution is vectored through this when the text interpreter does not
  find a word in the dictionary.  This is usually bound to either
  opf_number_interpret or opf_number_compile but users are free to bind
  it to other words in order to extend/alter the text interpreter.


opf_number_vector
 inputs:
   see opf_undefined_vector
 outputs:
   %ecx' = 0 if %esi is a valid number, non-zero otherwise.
   %edi' = the converted number.
   %esi' = %esi + %ecx + 1
   %ebx' = opf_B
 what:
  Execution is vectored through this when the text interpreter wants
  to convert the string representation of a number into the number.
  The default action is to treat the string as representing an unsigned
  integer.


opf_not_number_vector
 inputs:
  see opf_undefined_vector
 outputs:
   whatever the vector wants to do.
 what:
  Execution is vectored through this if opf_number_vector fails to
  convert the string into a number.  The default action is to output
  the word followed by a " ?\n" and then vector execution via
  opf_abort_vector.


opf_abort_vector
 inputs:
  %eax = code indicating the nature of the problem.
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Execution is vectored through this when things go wrong.
  Unfortunately, not all code that vectors through opf_abort_vector set
  %eax correctly, so sometimes it contains some random value :-<


opf_vector_swap_cache
 what:
  See opf_swap_state_code.


opf_word_fail_msg
 what:
  This is the string that is output after a word is encountered by the
  text interpreter that it cannot find a definition for or otherwise
  process.  See opf_bad_word_abort for more information.

_start
 inputs:
  *%esp = number of arguments to this process.
  %esp+4 = address of argv vector.
 what:
  This is where execution begins.  First the command line is parsed.
  See the associated manual page for the options.
 how:
  Any library directories to search are stored on the return stack.  Since
  they must be searched in the order they are given and the stack grows
  down opf_L is initialised with the address of a stack slot
  containing 0.  See opf_cmd_line_lib for more information.


opf_cmd_line_base
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
 outputs:
  opf_B
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '-b' then the rest of the
  option is assumed to be a string representing the integer base which
  the rest of the computation should be performed in.  If the conversion
  is successful then opf_B is set to the new base then the next option
  is parsed otherwise an error is reported.


opf_cmd_line_code_size
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
 outputs:
  opf_C_size
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '-c' then the rest of the
  option is assumed to be a string representing an integer which is
  the number of of bytes to allocate for the code space.  If the conversion
  is successful then opf_C_size is set to the integer then the next option
  is parsed otherwise an error is reported.


opf_cmd_line_header_size
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
 outputs:
  opf_C_size
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '-h' then the rest of the
  option is assumed to be a string representing an integer which is
  the number of of bytes to allocate for the header space.  If the conversion
  is successful then opf_H_size is set to the integer then the next option
  is parsed otherwise an error is reported.


opf_cmd_line_param_size
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
 outputs:
  opf_C_size
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '-p' then the rest of the
  option is assumed to be a string representing an integer which is
  the number of of bytes to allocate for the parameter stack space.
  If the conversion is successful then opf_P_size is set to the integer
  then the next option is parsed otherwise an error is reported.


opf_cmd_line_lib
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
  *%esp = 0
 outputs:
  %esp' = %esp - 4
  *%esp = %esi+2
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '-l' then the rest of the
  option is assumed to be a directory name and it is added to the list of
  directories to search when looking for a file.  If the option is not
  '-l' then execution continues with opf_cmd_line_end.
 how:
  The '-' part has already been checked and so it suffices to check if
  the next character is 'l'.  If it is then the start of the directory
  pathname (%esi+2) replaces the terminating 0 on the return stack and
  a new terminator is pushed onto the stack.


opf_cmd_line_end
 inputs:
  %esi = address of the first character in the command line option.
 what:
  If the option (as pointed to by %esi) is '--' then this terminates the
  command line processing and opf_cmd_line_input_from_stdin.
 how:
  To make sure that garbage such as '--foo' is not accepted, a check
  for a NUL is done.  To avoid two tests, a word compare is used.


opf_cmd_line_input_from_stdin
 inputs:
  -
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Initialises the parameter stack, code and header sections and then
  reads OPF from the standard input.  On completion, OPF is exited returning
  opf_exit_success to the parent process.


opf_cmd_line_input_from_file
 inputs:
  %esi = address of start of file-name to read OPF from.
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Adjusts the command line arguments so that, in accordance with usual
  scripting behaviour, the file name becomes the zeroth argument.  Then
  opens the file whose name is in %ebx and parses it as OPF.  On completion
  the file is closed and OPF is exited returning opf_exit_success to
  the parent process.


opf_exit:
 inputs:
  -
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Terminates the process returning opf_exit_success to the parent process.


opf_cmd_line_parse_int
 inputs:
  %edx = address of location to store the converted integer in.
  %esi = address of first character in option to convert to an integer.
         The integer should start at %esi+2.
 outputs:
  %edx' = %edx
  %ecx' = 0
  %esi' = %esi
  %edi = converted number.
 what:
  Converts the string pointed to by %esi into an integer.  If successful,
  continues processing at opf_cmd_line_next i.e. the routine technically
  does not return, in an attempt to save a byte or two it jumps directly
  back into the command line interpreter.  If the string does not represent
  an integer, then execution proceeds to opf_bad_word_abort so that the
  faulty integer is output before execution is vectored through 
  opf_abort_vector.

  A routine like this that does not return is a classic example of why
  assembler can turn into an unmaintainable mess.  


opf_cmd_line_setup_args
 inputs:
  -
 outputs:
  %ebp' = address + 4 of the newly allocated parameter stack section.
 what:
  Allocates memory for the code section (opf_C), header section
  (opf_H), and parameter stack (opf_P) before initialising %ebp to point
  at the end of the parameter stack section.


opf_text_interpreter
 inputs:
  -
 trashes:
  all registers.
 outputs:
  it does not return until EOI or there is an error reading a word.
 what:
  The text interpreter.  This attempts to read a word from the
  current input and if successful looks the word up.  If the word is
  defined then execution is vectored through opf_defined_vector
  otherwise it goes through opf_undefined_vector.  Assuming either returns
  (which they might not if some error occurs), then the process is repeated.
  Notice that the text interpreter does not directly perform any interpretation
  or execution, this is handled entirely by the contents of the two vectors.
  This approach makes it possible to extend the interpreter in various ways.
  This is clearly a nice feature but it is not clear whether it is necessary,
  there is always the option of just writing a separate text interpreter.
 how:
  The choice of which vector to use is achieved without an explicit test in
  opf_text_interpreter via a fragile hack: the two vectors are next to each
  other (defined first) and by pre-loading %ebx with the address of
  opf_defined_vector, opf_dict_find adjusts %ebx if it cannot find the word.
  Hence a direct call to (%ebx) will result in execution vectoring via the
  correct vector.
 

opf_defined_interpret
 inputs:
  see opf_defined_vector.
 outputs:
  -
 what: 
  Executes the code associated with the word whose header is in %edx.


opf_defined_compile
 inputs:
  see opf_defined_vector.
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Executes the compiler associated with the word whose header is in %edx.


opf_number_convert
 inputs:
  see opf_undefined_vector.
 outputs:
  %ecx' = %ecx
  %esi' = %esi  
  %edi' = /* converted number */
 what:
  Converts the string into a number.  If the string cannot be converted
  then execution is vectored through opf_not_number_vector.


opf_bad_word_abort
 inputs:
  %ecx = length of string to output
  %esi = address of first character of string to output
 outputs:
  %eax' = opf_error_bad_word
  %ebx' = opf_stderr
  %ecx' = opf_word_fail_msg
  %edx' = 3
  %esi' = %esi
 what:
  Writes out the string represented by %ecx and %esi followed by a '?'
  to the standard output and then vectors execution via opf_abort_vector.
 

opf_number_interpret
 inputs:
  see opf_undefined_vector.
 outputs:
  %ecx' = 0
  %ebp  = %ebp'-4 
  *ebp' = %eax 
  %eax  = /* the number */
 what:
  Converts string pointed to by %esi into a number using opf_number_vector
  and pushes the result on the parameter stack.  If it not possible to
  convert the string to a number then execution is vectored via 
  opf_abort_vector.


opf_number_compile
 inputs:
  see opf_undefined_vector.
 outputs:
  %ebx' = opf_C + 11
  %ecx' = opf_end_def_code_standard
  %edx' = opf_end_def_head
  %edi' = %edi
  opf_C' = opf_C + 11
 what:
  Convert the string in %esi into a number (see opf_number_convert) and
  if that is successful, plant some code to push the number on the stack.
  (see opf_number_plant_literal).


opf_number_plant_literal
 inputs:
  %edi = number to plant
 outputs:
  %ebx' = *opf_C + 11
  %edx' = opf_q_head_lit
  %edi' = *opf_C
  *opf_C' = %ebx'
 what:
  Takes the integer in %edi and extends the current word such that when
  the word is executed it will push the value of %edi onto S.  Also
  adds an entry into the compilation queue.
 how:
  As default for a given literal XXXXXXXX the following code is
  planted at opf_C :- 

    89 45 FC        movl %eax, -okf_cell_size(%ebp)
    B8 XX XX XX XX  movl $XXXXXXXX, %eax
    83 ED 04        subl $okf_cell_size, %ebp
 
  This is used rather than planting a call to a <code>(lit)</code> function
  followed by the integer since that would take 9 bytes which is only
  two less than the above sequence and is considerably slower.

  If the preceeding word to be compiled was a <code>drop</code> then instead
  of planting all of the above, only the following is planted over where
  the drop code was originaly planted :-

    B8 XX XX XX XX  movl $XXXXXXXX, %eax

  In either case the entry in the compilation queue has a valid
  opf_q_code slot but the fact this is a literal is marked by having
  either opf_q_head_lit or opf_q_head_drop_lit in the 
  opf_q_head slot rather than a legal dictionary header.



opf_compile_call
 inputs:
  see opf_defined_vector
 outputs:
  %ebx' = opf_h_code(%edx) - (*opf_C+opf_call_size)
  %edx' = %edx
  %edi' = *opf_C + opf_call_size
  *opf_C' = %edi'
 what:
  Plants a call to the code of the word whose dictionary header is in
  %edx and updates opf_C by opf_call_size.
 how:
  The jiggery-pokery that goes on is because calls are relative and
  must be calculated from the first byte after the call instruction
  itself i.e. call 0 would result in the next instruction being called.
 

opf_compile_inline
 inputs:
  see opf_defined_vector
 outputs:
  %ecx = 0
  %edx' = %edx
  %edi' = opf_C'
  %esi' = unspecified
  opf_C' = opf_C + /* size of code for word in pointed to be %edx */
 what:
  Inlines the word whose header is pointed to by %edx.
 how:
  A <code>rep</code> and <code>movsb</code> are because they take much
  less space than an explicit loop.


opf_Q_add
 inputs:
  %edx = address of header of word being compiled.
  %edi = address in current word where code will be planted.
  opf_Qi 
 outputs:
  %edx' = %edx
  %ecx' = opf_Q
  %edi' = %edi
  %esi' = opf_Qi' + 8
  %opf_Qi' = %esi'
 what:
  Adds the %edx/%edi pair to the code optimisation queue, wrapping around
  if necessary.


opf_abort
 inputs:
  see opf_abort_vector
 outputs:
  see opf_abort_vector
 what:
  Vectors execution via opf_abort_vector.  This is just here to avoid
  reduce the size of the code since various places want to vector via
  opf_abort_vector.


opf_abort_default
 inputs:
  see opf_abort_vector
 what:
  Terminates the process with a non-zero value.


opf_in_wsw
 inputs:
  opf_H
  opf_I
 outputs:
  %ecx' = > 0 - length of word
          = 0 - end of input
          < 0 - error 
  %ebx' = %ebx
  %esi' = address of first char in word
  %edi' = address of last char in word + 1
  %edx' = unspecified
  opf_I' = opf_I
  opf_H' = opf_H
 what:
  Read a whitespace delimited word from the current input (opf_I) and
  store the resulting string starting at opf_H.  %edx indicates whether
  the word was read successfully (greater than 0) or not (less than or
  equal to 0).


opf_in_fd_refill
 input:
  %ebx - input file descriptor
 output:
  %ebx = %ebx'
  %ecx = address of one past last character read in.
  %edx = > 0 - nchars read
         = 0 - end of input
         < 0 - error 
 what:
  Refill the input buffer from a file descriptor.
  Note this should not be called directly, it should be placed in
  the opf_in_refill slot of a input buffer attached to a file descriptor.


opf_in_skip
 input:
  %cl  - char to skip to.
 output:
  %ebx' = %ebx
  %cl' = %cl
  %esi' = unspecified
  %edx = > 0 - nchars read
         = 0 - end of input
         < 0 - error 
 what:
  Skip all the input chars up to an including the given character.
  If the end of the input or an error reading more input occurs before
  the character is found then %edx will be less than or equal to zero.
 how:
  \n is used as a buffer sentinel and it is also one of
  the most common characters to search for.  This slightly complicates
  the terminating condition.   Once a \n has been found and it has been
  determined that this is not the end of the buffer the obvious thing
  to do might be to read the next character (opf_in_skip_next).  However,
  this is not correct, the next thing should be to check whether the
  character being searched for has been found (opf_in_skip_check_char).


opf_atou
 inputs:
  %ecx = length of string to convert (if not NUL terminated).
  %esi = start of string.
  opf_B = base to convert string by.
 outputs:
  %ecx' = 0 if string is a number
  %edi' = number
  %ebx' = opf_B
  opf_base' = opf_B
  %esi' = %esi + %ecx + 1
 what:
  Converts the string starting at %esi into an unsigned number.  If the
  conversion is successful, %ecx' is 0 and %edi' contains the number.
  If the conversion fails, then %ecx' contains a non-zero value and the
  contents of %edi' are unspecified.
 

opf_dict_find
 inputs:
  %ecx = length of string to search for.
  %esi = start of string to search for.
  %ebx = unspecified.
 outputs:
  (and
    (= %ecx %ecx')
    (or
      (and %edx' (= %ebx' %ebx) (= %edi' %esi) (= %esi' (+ %esi %ecx)))
      (and (= %edx' 0) (= %ebx' (+ %ebx 4)) (= %edi' opf_H) (= %esi' %esi))))
 what:
  Locate a string in the dictionary.

  Note that whilst the input length is 32-bit, only 8-bits (%cl) are
  actually taken notice of.

  A non-zero %edx' is the address of header of found word 
  (i.e. address of name length in the header).

  Does the apparently peculiar thing of adding 4 to %ebx if a matching
  entry is found.  This is used to optimize the main loop by avoiding
  another test and jump, see the code for opf_text_interpreter for more
  information.


opf_in_word_code
 what:
  Reads in a whitespace delimited word from the input (opf_I) into 
  the space pointed to by opf_H and if successfully read pushes the address
  of the start of the string (which is still the same as opf_H) and the
  length of the string onto the parameter stack.


opf_vars_code
 inputs:
  %eax = number of the variable to access (starting at 0).
 outputs:
  %eax' = address of the nth internal variable.
  %ebx' = address of the 1st internal variable.
 what:
  Provides access to the internal variables of OPF.  Returns the address
  of the nth variable in %eax.

opf_debug_break
 what:
  Provides a mechanism for breakpointing OPF while it is executing a script.
  Set a breakpoint on it and place any word bound to this in your code and
  hey-presto you have a breakpoint at the required part of your script.
  If you know you aren't going to access 15 in the code, then the
  following will cause a breakpoint to be fired :-

   b opf_debug_break
   condition 1 ($eax == 15)


opf_line_comment_code
 what:
  Skip everything up to and including next <code>\n</code> in the input.
  When bound to <code>#!</code> it makes it possible for OPF scripts to
  be executed directly under UNIX.  For example, if OPF is installed
  as <code>/usr/local/bin/opf</code>, you can create an shell with POSIX
  features like :-

   $ cat posix-forth
   #! /usr/local/bin/opf
   #< /usr/local/lib/opf/posix.opf
   0 #{

  and when you type posix-forth it will create an interactive OPF shell
  with added posix features.


opf_dict_store_word_code
 what:
  Pops the top of the stack and stores it at the address contained in opf_C.


opf_input_from_fd_code
 what:
  As per opf_input_from_fd, except that %ebx is cleared since there
  is no file.


opf_input_from_fd
 inputs:
  %eax = file descriptor to read from
  %ebx = input file name
 outputs:
  %eax' = %eax
  everything else is unspecified.
 what:
  Creates a new opf_in_fd structure on the return stack and initialises
  it with the file descriptor (%eax), file-name (%ebx), refill function
  (opf_in_fd_refill), and input buffer (also allocated on the return stack).
  After making this the default input (opf_I), calls the text interpreter 
  (opf_text_interpreter) to evaluate the input.  If successful, the
  opf_in_fd structure is removed and input is restored to the previous 
  opf_in structure.


opf_input_from_file_code
 inputs:
  -
 outputs:
  see opf_boot_from_file.
 what:
  Reads a whitespace terminated string from the current input (opf_I),
  NUL terminates it and then uses opf_boot_from_file to open, evaluate
  and then close the file.


opf_boot_from_file
 inputs:
  %ebx = address of string containing name of file to read from.
 outputs:
  %eax' = %eax
  %ebx' = file descriptor that was attached to the file while it was
          being read -- it is closed.
  %ecx' = unspecified
  %esi' = unspecified
  %edi' = unspecified
 what:
  Opens the file whose name is pointed to by %ebx, evaluates its
  contents as OPF and closes the file (any problems closing the file
  are ignored).  If the file cannot be opened then XXX.

  If the file name is not absolute (i.e. begins with '/') then it is
  searched for along the library path (what opf_L points at).
 how:
  Open the file as O_RDONLY (which is 0, hence the clearing of %ecx) and
  use opf_input_from_fd to read in file file.  Internally
  opf_input_from_fd uses <code>read(2)</code> to read in the source, but an
  alternative would be to use <code>mmap(2)</code> to map in the whole file.
  This is not done for two reasons.  The main reason is space.  The
  <code>read(2)</code> versions is needed to support reading from the
  standard input and so using a separate <code>mmap</code> would take
  up more space.  The second reason is that that experiments done with
  Linux 2.0.13 on my little 486 portable don't show any speed
  improvement through using mmap and so there is no benefit to using
  it.   Note the same experiments under on a SPARC under SunOS and
  Solaris do show a performance increase and so <code>mmap(2)</code>
  would be worth considering on those platforms.  Also on these platforms
  <code>madvise(2)</code> is available and can be used to indicate that
  the file will be accessed sequentially and so only one or two pages are
  allocated rather than wasting VM on the whole file.


opf_boot_from_file_not_found
 inputs:
  %ebx = address of first character in NUL terminated file name.
  *(%esp+0) = %ebx
  *(%esp+1) = saved value of %eax
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  Outputs the file name to the standard error stream followed by a '?'
  and then vectors execution through opf_abort_vector.
  

opf_strcpy
 inputs:
  %esi = address of first character in string to copy.
  %edi = address to copy to.
 outputs:
  %esi' = %esi + length of string
  %edi' = %edi + length of string
 what:
  Copies the NUL terminated string at %esi to %edi.
 how:
  Since I don't have opf/bib#pentium around I can't remember what the
  precise sequence using a rep is.  Therefore, coded it as an explicit
  loop.


opf_strlen
 inputs:
  %esi = address of first character in NUL terminated string.
 outputs:
  %esi' = %esi + %ecx'
  %ecx' = length of string.
 what:
  Counts the length of the NUL terminated string at %esi.
 how:
  Since I don't have opf/bib#pentium around I can't remember what the
  precise sequence using a rep is.  Therefore, coded it as an explicit
  loop.


opf_double_code
 inputs:
  %eax = number to double
 outputs:
  %eax' = 2*%eax
 what:
  Multplies %eax by 2.
 how:
  Uses a left shift.


opf_halve_code
 inputs:
  %eax = number to halve
 outputs:
  %eax' = %eax/2
 what:
  Divides %eax by 2.
 how:
  Uses a right shift.  This is really an unsigned divide, it does not
  preserve the sign bit.  Will alter when I get my hands on opf/bib#pentium 
  again.


opf_dup_code
 inputs:
  %eax = value to duplicate
 outputs:
  %eax' = %eax
  *%ebp' = %eax
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
 what:
  Creates a copy of %eax on the top of the stack.


opf_drop_code XXX
opf_over_code XXX
opf_nip_code XXX
opf_tuck_code XXX
opf_swap_code XXX
opf_push_code XXX
opf_pop_code XXX
opf_sum_code XXX
opf_sub_code XXX


opf_compile_add_sub
 inputs:
  %edx = dictionary header of either <code>+</code> or </code>-</code>.
 outputs:
  -
 what:
  A special purpose compiler for <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>.
  If the last word compiled is a literal, then an optimised sequence
  is planted.  Whether it is <code>+</code> or </code>-</code> is controlled
  by the dictionary header in %edx, an opcode table is kept at an
  offset of opf_h_add_sub_table in the headers of both of these words.
 how:
  If the last word is not a literal then opf_add_code is planted inline.
  If the last word is a literal, then what is planted depends on the
  size of the literal.  If its absolute value of the literal is > 255
  then a full add/subtract is required.  If the literal is 1 then
  a incl/decl can be used.  If it is between 1 and 255 then a short form
  of add/sub is used.


opf_le_code
 inputs:
  %eax  = b
  *%ebp = a
 outputs:
  %eax' = 1 if a <= b otherwise 0.
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
 what:
  Determines if a <= b.
 how:
  The quickest way I could think of was to perform <code>b-a</code>, flip
  the bits and then use the sign bit in the result to indicate whether
  <code>a<=b</code>.
  

opf_gt_code
 inputs:
  %eax  = b
  *%ebp = a
 outputs:
  %eax' = 1 if a > b otherwise 0.
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
 what:
  Determines if a > b.
 how:
  The quickest way I could think of was to perform <code>b-a</code> and
  then use the sign bit in the result to indicate whether <code>a>b</code>.


opf_and_code XXX
opf_or_code XXX
opf_xor_code XXX
opf_store_code XXX
opf_fetch_code XXX


opf_swap_state_code
 what:
  Swaps the contents of opf_defined_vector and opf_undefined_vector
  with the values in the opf_vector_swap_cache.  This is the action
  that both <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> perform.
 how:
  The floating point hardware is used since this is the most efficient
  method of swapping two 64-bit values.  This could overflow the hardware
  floating point stack and lose some data if it is being left around across
  calls to opf_swap_state_code.  Perhaps should go the whole way and have a
  stack rather than just swapping back and forth?  It would certainly be
  more flexible.


opf_return_code
 inputs:
  -
 outputs:
  unspecified
 what: 
  A <code>;</code> has been reached and now there is a decision about
  what do do.  The decision is based on the following table :-

   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+
   | one word? |   call?   | inlineable? ||        action        |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+
   |    no     |    yes    |      -      ||  change to tail call |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+
   |    no     |     no    |      -      ||    plant a ret       |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+
   |   yes     |    yes    |      -      ||  alias previous def. |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+
   |   yes     |     no    |     yes     ||  make inline word    |
   +-----------+-----------+-------------++----------------------+

  the following is a key to the headings in the table :-

   one word? 
     Does the body consist of just one reference to another word?
     That is, is it of the form :-

      : foo bar ;

   call?
     Is the last code planted a call instruction?

   inlinable?
     Is the body of the definition short enough to be inlined when referenced.

   action
     The action if all the conditions in the row match.
 how:
  call?
   This is determined by checking if the last instruction planted
   starts with E8, the opcode code for a call.
  one word?
   This is determined by comparing the address of the last instruction
   with the address of the start of the code area.  If they are the same
   then only one word has been compiled, though it may have been inlined.
  inlinable?
   Any word which takes less than opf_inline_size bytes is considered a
   candidate for inlining.
  
opf_return_code_inline
 inputs:
  %ebx = length in bytes of body of current word
  %ecx = address of last entry in the compilation queue.
  %edx = address of header of current word.
  %esi = address of the first instruction in the current word.
  %edi = address of next available space in code space.
 outputs:
  %ecx' = %ecx
  %ebx' = *opf_Qi'
  %edx' = %edx
  %esi' = start address of code being aliased
  %edi' = address of compilation code for word being aliased.
  *opf_Qi' = (*opf_Qi - 1) mod opf_Q_size
  *opf_H' = *opf_H + 1
 what:
  The only word in the current word was inlined.  That is the current
  definition is of the form :-

   : foo { bar } ;
  or
   : foo { <number> } ;

  where <code>bar</code> has been inlined into <code>foo</code> or
  <code>foo</code> is a constant definition.  In the former case there
  is no need to keep the code section for <code>foo</code> it can be
  shared with <code>bar</code>.  In the latter case the code section
  needs to be kept since this is the definition of a constant.  In both
  cases <code>foo</code> should be marked as an inlinable word.
 how:
  The entry is not really flushed since it does no harm to leave it there, 
  all that happens is that the index is backed up by one.

opf_return_code_alias
 inputs:
  %edx = address of header of current word.
  %edi = address of next available space to plant code.
 outputs:
  %ecx' = address of code of aliased word
  %edi' = %edi - opf_call_size
  *opf_C = %edi'
 what:
  The current word is an alias for another word, but not one that is
  inlinable.  That is, the current word is of the form

    : foo bar ;

  where <code>bar</code> is not an inlined word.  So, instead of having
  a definition which just calls another definition, the header for the
  current word is altered so that it points directly at the code for the
  aliased word and the space that was taken up by the call is reclaimed.


opf_def_code
 inputs:
  opf_D =
  opf_H =
  opf_C =
  opf_X = 
 outputs:
  opf_C' = opf_C
  opf_D' = opf_H' - opf_h__size
  opf_H' = opf_H + opf_h__size + /* length of word name */
  opf_X' = opf_X
 what:
  Reads a whitespace delimited word from the current input (opf_I) into
  opf_H and creates a header for it setting the compiler (opf_h_comp)
  to whatever opf_X contains and pointing the code (opf_h_code) to the
  current value of opf_C.


opf_u_to_string
 inputs:
  %eax = number to convert
  %ebx = address of one byte past the end where the string should be placed.
 outputs:
  %ebx' = address of first character in the string.
  %esi' = %ebx - %ebx' i.e. the length of the string.
  %edx' = unspecified
 what:
  Converts the unsigned integer in %eax into a string.  It is positioned such
  that the last character in the string is at %ebx-1.  The reason for
  starting at the end is that it is more efficient to do it that way.


opf_type_code
 inputs:
  %eax = length of the string to output.
  *%ebp = address of the start of the string to output.
 outputs:
  %eax' = *%ebp
  %ebx' = unspecified
  %ecx' = unspecified
  %edx' = unspecified
  %ebp' = %ebp + 4
 what:
  Writes out the string whose address is at *%ebp and whose length is in
  %eax to the standard output.  No indication of success/failure is given.


opf_emit_code
 inputs:
  %eax = character to output (only %al is taken notice of).
 outputs:
  %eax' = *%ebp
  %ebp' = %ebp + 4
 what:
  Write out the character to the standard output.  No indication of 
  success/failure is given.
 how:
  To keep the code safe in the event of pre-emptive threads, rather than
  use a static buffer of some sort to hold the character, it is pushed
  onto the return stack and its address is taken.  Earlier versions
  made use of opf_type_code to output the character, but with the change
  to not using fixed area to hold the character it was decided that any
  code space saving was marginal.


opf_type_code
 inputs:
  %eax = length of string to output
  *%ebp = address of start of string.
 outputs:
 what:
  Outputs the string to the standard output.


opf_dot_code
  inputs:
   %eax = number to output
   opf_B = base to output in
  outputs:
   opf_B' = opf_B
   %eax' = *%ebp'
   %ebp' = %ebp+4
  what:
   Writes %eax as an unsigned integer according to the current base.
  how:
   Converts %eax into a string and then writes it out.  To keep the code
   re-entrant in the face of premptive threads, the space for string
   is allocated on the return stack.


opf_if_code
 outputs:
  %eax' = address+1 of byte to patch with destination.
  *%ebp' = %eax
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
  opf_C' = opf_C + 4
 what:
  Alters the runtime execution of word being defined such that any
  following code is only executed if %eax at that point contains a
  non-zero value.  If %eax contains zero, then execution continues after
  the next <code>then</code> that occurs in the code -- there must be
  a <code>then</code> or the result is <code>undefined</code>.

  Unlike ANS and most traditional Forth implementations, OPF <code>if</code>
  does not pop the condition being tested.  This makes it very useful in
  the common case where you just want to test if something is non-zero.
  Instead of having to write :-

   : foo DUP IF non-zero ELSE DROP zero THEN ; 

  which results in a redundant DUP and DROP, you can write :-

   : foo if { non-zero } ; then { zero } ;

  If the <code>if</code> is preceded by some sort of condition check, e.g.
  <code><</code>, then you may prefer to use <code>!if</code> which behaves
  more like a traditional Forth <code>if</code>.
 how:
  Plants the following code at opf_C :-

   85 C0     testl %eax, %eax
   74 XX     jz +XX

  The 8-bit branch is used in preference to the larger ones because it
  saves space in the common case.  If you need a larger branch offset than
  is allowed by 8-bits then factor your code!

  The address+1 is returned rather than address simply because doing so
  takes less instructions.  It is up to opf_if_code and opf_then_code
  to cooperate in this respect.


opf_lif_cond_table
 what:
  A table of entries which lists which words are optimised by opf_lif_code.
  Each entry consists of a code address and an opcode.  The reason for
  using code addresses rather than header addresses is that the latter
  would fail in the face of aliases.


opf_lif_code
 outputs:
  %eax' = address+1 of byte to patch with destination.
  *%ebp' = %eax
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
  opf_C' = opf_C + 4
 what:
  Alters the runtime execution of word being defined such that any
  following code is only executed if %eax at that point contains a
  non-zero value.  If %eax contains zero, then execution continues after
  the next <code>then</code> that occurs in the code -- there must be
  a <code>then</code> or the result is <code>undefined</code>.

  Like a traditional Forth, <code>!if</code> consumes the condition on
  the top of the stack.

  The use of <code>!</code> in the name is a reference to the use of
  <code>!</code> in linear logic to refer to linear variables.  It could
  be confused with traditional Forth use of a <code>!</code> suffix or
  prefix to mean some form of storage but I won't make that mistake even
  if others will :-)
 how:
  The default is to plant the following code at opf_C :-

   89 C3     movl  %eax, %ebx
   8B 45 00  movl  (%ebp), %eax
   83 C5 04  addl  $opf_cell_size, %ebp
   85 DB     testl %ebx, %ebx
   74 XX     jz +XX

  The 8-bit branch is used in preference to the larger ones because it
  saves space in the common case.  If you need a larger branch offset than
  is allowed by 8-bits then factor your code!

  The address+1 is returned rather than address simply because doing so
  takes less instructions.  It is up to opf_if_code and opf_then_code
  to cooperate in this respect.

  If the previous word that was compiled is listed in
  smf_lif_cond_table then the slightly longer sequence of the form :- 

   89 C3     movl  %eax, %ebx
   8B 4D 00  movl  (%ebp), %ecx
   8B 45 04  movl  opf_cell_size(%ebp), %eax
   83 C5 08  addl  $(2*opf_cell_size), %ebp
   39 D9     cmpl  %ebx, %ecx
   7Y XX     jY +XX

  is planted instead.  Although it is longer, since it is planted over
  the previous word, it results in a shorter sequence altogether.
  Y if filled in with the branch instruction as indicated in the
  appropriate smf_lif_cond_table entry. 


opf_then_code
 inputs:
  %eax = address+1 of byte to patch 
  opf_C = address that the patched byte should refer to.
 outputs:
  %eax' = *%ebx
  %ebx' = %ebx + 4
  opf_C' = opf_C
 what:
  XXX
 how:
  Calculates the correct offset between opf_C and the patch address in %eax
  and patches the address.


opf_string_code
 inputs:
 outputs:
   see outputs of opf_parse_code
 what:
  Reads a <code>"</code> terminated string from the input and leaves its
  address and length on the parameter stack.


opf_parse_code
 inputs:
  %eax = char to read until.
 outputs:
  %ebx' = opf_H
  %eax' = /* number of characters read */
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
  *%ebp' = opf_H
  opf_H' = opf_H + %eax'
 what:
  Reads characters from the input and stores them starting at opf_H.
  Characters are read and stored until a char matching %eax is read --
  this character is not stored.  If the input runs out before the 
  terminating character is found then execution is vectored through
  opf_abort_vector with %eax = opf_error_eoi.


opf_tick_code
 inputs:
 outputs:
  %eax = address of word header or 0 if no such word.
 what:
  Parses a whitespace delimited word from the input and looks it up in
  the dictionary.  If the word is in the dictionary then the address
  of its header is returned.  If the word is not in the dictionary then
  0 is returned.


opf_compile_code
 inputs:
  %eax = address of header of word to compile.
 outputs:
  %eax' = *%ebp
  %ebp' = %ebp - 4
 what:
  Compiles the word whose header is in %eax.
 how:
  The compilation is vectored through the word specific compiler in opf_h_comp


opf_trap_n_code
 inputs:
  %eax = number of arguments the system call takes
  *%ebp = system call number
  *(%ebp+1*4) = first argument 
  *(%ebp+2*4) = second argument
  ...
 outputs:
  %ebp' = %ebp + %eax*4 + 4
  %eax = /* value returned by system call */
 what:
  Performs the system call whose number is in *%ebx, passing %eax arguments
  to the system call.  The result of the system call is left in %eax.
 how:
  If there are more than three arguments, then the kernel wants the address
  of the first argument, with all the other arguments allocated in successive
  locations.  This is an old style kernel call.

  If there are less than four arguments, then the kernel wants the arguments
  in registers.  %ebx = first, %ecx = second, %edx = third.  To keep the
  size of the code down, a combination of a jump table and fall through
  are used: the number of arguments is used to find the correct address
  to jump to and the unpack code for argument n falls through to n-1.
  This relies on the code for unpacking each argument being the same fixed
  size.  To take advantage of one of the complicated addressing modes, the
  code has been padded to make it 4 bytes long.  If it was left at 3
  bytes it would require a shift and add.  Perhaps that would be shorter
  than the nops?  Should check this out.


opf_anon_mmap
 inputs:
  %ecx = address of word to store base of allocated memory at.
  *(%ecx+4) = number of bytes to allocate
 outputs:
  %eax' = address of start of allocated region.
  *%ecx = %eax'
 what:
  Allocates *(%ecx+4) bytes of memory (this will be rounded up to the
  nearest page) and returns the address of the allocated block in %eax
  and also stores it in *%ecx.  If the memory cannot be allocated then
  execution is vectored through opf_abort_vector with %eax containing
  the error code.

  The reason for the odd input convention is that it allows to values to
  be passed with one register and so saves on code space.  The approach
  currently costs nothing because it is easy to arrange that the two
  locations lie next to each other.
 how:
  As the name suggests, uses mmap to allocate the memory.

  Since the Linux kernel cannot currently accept more than 4 arguments
  via registers, it is necessary to create an argument block and store
  the arguments in it before passing the address of the argument block
  in %ebx.  Since the routine does not need to be re-entrant the argument
  block could be carved out of some available space once and for all and
  reused.  The only reason that is not done and the return stack is used
  is that the latter is simpler and takes less code (pushl can be used
  to initialise on the stack and this has a short code sequence).

  The mapping takes advantage of support for anonymous mappings in Linux.
  The alternative would be to open /dev/zero and map that but it would take
  more code :-<

  opf_mmap_map_private is passed along with opf_mmap_map_anonymous because
  without it mmap will return EINVAL (discovered by looking at the
  source in /usr/src/linux/mm/mmap.c#do_mmap).

  Since opf_mmap_map_anonymous is being used, the file descriptor argument
  is not read by the kernel, so any old junk can be passed.

opf_sub_opcodes
 what:
  A table of opcodes which are used to parameterise opf_compile_add_sub
  so that it will plant the correct <code>sub</code> instruction.

opf_add_opcodes
 what:
  A table of opcodes which are used to parameterise opf_compile_add_sub
  so that it will plant the correct <code>add</code> instruction.
